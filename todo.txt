To Do list:

- selected folders add up in list, need check not to duplicate mails.
- selected emails only append once to list, list seems te be getting emptied after each click.
- add a button to remove selected mails from list.
- how to select several mails at once, so that langchain can loop through them. 
- require cleaning of emails to remove hyperlinks, email adresses, graphics, etc. so that only relevant text remains.
