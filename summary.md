### Summary of Implemented Features

- **Login Window**: A GUI window where users can enter their email credentials to log in.
- **Main Application Window**: The primary interface of the application, divided into two panes:
    - **Left Pane**: Displays a list of email folders from the user's account.
    - **Right Pane**: Shows emails from the selected folder, with details like sender, subject, and date.
- **Email Client Integration**: A backend module (`EmailClient`) that connects to an IMAP server, fetches email folders, and retrieves emails from the selected folder.
- **Email Selection for Analysis**: Functionality to select emails from the list and accumulate their bodies in a data structure for further analysis.

### Next Steps for Development

- **LangChain Integration**: Incorporate LangChain to analyze the accumulated email data.
- **Enhance UI/UX**: Improve the user interface for better usability, such as adding buttons, menus, and status messages.
- **Add More Features**: Implement features like pagination, search, and filtering for email lists.
- **Error Handling and Security**: Add robust error handling, especially for network issues and authentication errors, and ensure secure handling of user credentials and email data.

This setup provides a solid foundation for your "mailytics" application. Tomorrow, we can continue to build upon this, integrating more features and refining the application.
